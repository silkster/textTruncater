# jQuery Text Truncater Plugin


This plugin adds an ellipsis to a text string at the point in the text where it will be truncated to its containers height and width.

The container should have height and width and its overflow should be set to hidden.  Then the plugin will determine the best place to put the ellipsis.

### Example usage:

$(function () {
    $('.recipe .recipe-title').textTruncator({
        maxHeight: 72,
        textSelector: 'a'
    });
});
